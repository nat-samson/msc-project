# PASSWORD RESET FUNCTIONALITY
# if DEBUG is True, password resets are sent to the console. You can stop reading here!
# If DEBUG is False, you must supply SMTP details.
# For convenience, Gmail settings have been provided as defaults, so if using Gmail, just provide username and
# app password. App passwords can be generated after setting up 2-factor authentication here:
# https://myaccount.google.com/security
# if not using Gmail, uncomment the other settings and override as necessary.
